When a variant of the Linux.Slapper.Worm family attacks a computer, it
attempts to connect on port 80. It sends an invalid GET request to the
server to identify the Apache system. After the worm finds an Apache system,
it tries to connect on port 443 to send the exploit code to the SSL service
that is listening on the remote computer.

The worm uses a Linux shell code exploit, which runs only on Intel
platforms. This code requires the presence of the shell command /bin/sh in
order to execute properly. The worm uuencodes its own source code and sends
it to the remote system. There it decodes the file, compiles it using gcc,
and runs the resulting binary file. All worm files are placed in the /tmp
directory.

The worm binary is executed with an IP address as a parameter. This IP
address is the address of the attacking computer, and is used to create a
peer-to-peer network of worm-infected systems for Denial of Service attack
purposes. Each compromised system listens on a UDP port to receive further
instructions. The port changes from one variant to another.
